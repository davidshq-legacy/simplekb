# SimpleKB
Version: 0.2 (10/12/2018)

An intentionally simple WordPress Knowledge Base plugin.

## Underlying Implementation

This plugin uses a custom post type (CPT), several taxonomies, and custom permalinks to store and display knowledge base entries.

## Recommended Plugin

If you need to provide individuals with access to the knowledge base plugin but don't want them making edits in other areas of your site, I'd recommend Justin Tadlock's Members plugin.

## ToDo

* Shortcodes currently use wordpress install specific term ids, need to make generic.
* Flush permalinks during activation.
* Auto-create guide types during activation.

## Authors

This plugin was created by Dave Mackey. It is based on a simple plugin created by Dave and Rick Murtagh for Liquid Church.
